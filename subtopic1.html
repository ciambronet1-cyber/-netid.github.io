      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This study evaluates the clinical performance of an artificial intelligence based system designed to assist with genome interpretation for patients with suspected rare genetic disorders. The authors examine how the model prioritizes variants, generates potential diagnoses, and compares to standard manual review methods used in clinical laboratories. The paper highlights the usefulness of automated tools for filtering large sets of genomic variants and speeding up the diagnostic workflow. It also discusses areas where human expertise remains essential, such as final diagnosis confirmation and phenotype matching. Overall, the study suggests that automated genome interpretation can complement clinical geneticists by reducing analysis time and increasing consistency, while still requiring oversight to ensure accuracy and prevent misclassification.</p>

      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This article explores how artificial intelligence can support rare disease diagnosis by interpreting whole-genome sequencing data at scale. The authors describe a computational framework that integrates phenotype information, disease databases, and variant-ranking algorithms to propose potential diagnostic candidates. Through case evaluations, the study demonstrates that AI can help highlight clinically relevant variants that may be overlooked during manual review, particularly in complex or atypical presentations. The paper emphasizes that AI does not replace clinical judgment but enhances diagnostic efficiency by narrowing the search space and identifying patterns across large datasets. It concludes that integrating AI into routine genomic analysis could significantly improve diagnostic yield for rare diseases, especially when used alongside experienced clinicians.</p>
