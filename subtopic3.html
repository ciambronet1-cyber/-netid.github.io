      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This narrative review discusses the emerging role of artificial intelligence in public health applications that rely on genetic data. The authors examine how AI algorithms can identify population-level risk patterns, support early detection of heritable conditions, and improve disease prevention strategies. The review highlights the importance of large-scale genetic databases and the challenges associated with using them responsibly, including privacy risks and unequal representation of demographic groups. Ethical considerations, such as consent, data security, and fairness in algorithmic predictions, are central themes throughout the paper. The authors argue that while AI offers promising tools for personalized public health, careful oversight and transparency will be essential to ensure that genetic information is used safely and equitably. The review concludes that AI has significant potential but must be applied with caution.</p>

      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This comprehensive review focuses on the growing need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in bioinformatics. The authors outline the challenges of using complex machine learning models, particularly deep learning, in areas such as genomics, proteomics, and systems biology where understanding model decisions is essential. The paper surveys various techniques used to interpret AI predictions and evaluates their strengths and limitations in biological contexts. It emphasizes that transparency is critical for clinical adoption, scientific reproducibility, and ethical responsibility, especially when AI is used to analyze sensitive genetic data. The authors conclude that while XAI is still developing, improving interpretability will be key to building trust in AI systems used in healthcare and biological research.</p>
