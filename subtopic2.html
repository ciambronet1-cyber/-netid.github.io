      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This review examines the role of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, focusing on how algorithms analyze genetic information to identify therapeutic targets. The paper outlines various machine learning methods used to model biological pathways, predict molecule–target interactions, and generate candidate compounds with favorable properties. It highlights the growing importance of genetics-driven drug design, where insights from genomic datasets guide the development of personalized or precision-based treatments. The article also discusses current barriers, including data limitations, validation challenges, and the need for transparent models that can be accepted by clinicians and regulatory agencies. Overall, the review argues that AI-powered genetic analysis has the potential to accelerate drug development and improve treatment specificity for genetically influenced diseases.</p>

      <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p>This paper reviews how artificial intelligence is transforming both pharmacogenomics and gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR. The authors describe how AI models predict how individuals may respond to medications based on their genetic profiles, enabling more personalized and safer drug therapies. Additionally, the article explains how machine learning assists in designing and optimizing CRISPR guide sequences, improving accuracy and reducing off-target effects. The review highlights the benefits of integrating AI with experimental approaches, noting that computational tools can guide laboratory decisions and reduce development time. It also addresses challenges such as algorithmic bias, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized datasets. The authors conclude that AI will play a central role in advancing precision medicine through both drug response prediction and more efficient gene editing.</p>
